<P>The first Jordan shoe was produced for basketball player Michael Jordan during his time with the Chicago Bulls in late 1984 and released to the public on April 1, 1985. 
The shoes were designed for Nike by Peter Moore, Tinker Hatfield, and Bruce Kilgore. Jordan is so famous?
The popularity of Jordans can be attributed to a number of factors, including the brand's history and legacy, distinctive design and style, high-quality construction and materials, exclusivity, and ownership and branding.
 The Jordan brand has become a cultural icon.
